      "Comments are an important part of most code, however, in some circumstances, theyend up just taking up space, and bandwidth.  Your task is to write a classComment with a method strip, which removes all the comments from apiece of code.  For this problem, we will consider only two type of comments:comments starting with \"//\" and comments starting with \"/*\" and ending with\"*/\".  The first type of comments removes everything starting from \"//\" untilthe end of the line.  The second type of comment removes everything, startingat \"/*\", until the sequence \"*/\" is found.  In addition comments may not benested in any way.  So, as soon as a \"/*\" comment is opened, everything iscommented, until a \"*/\" is found.  Thus the String \"/*//*/code\", withoutcomments, is \"code\".  Note that even though \"//\" is present, it does notcomment out code, because it is commented out itself, by the comment startingwith \"/*\".  Similarly, the neither \"//*\" nor \"///*\" open a \"/*\" comment, because everything after the \"//\" is already commented out, and thus can notstart a comment.\n",
      "However, it is not enough to simple search for the sequence \"//\" and \"/*\",because these could be surrounded by quotes, and thus not a comment.  Forexample, in the code:\n",
      "String s = \"//\";\n",
      "\"//\" does not start a comment, because it is part of a String.  A String beginsat a '\"', which is not commented.  A String ends at the first non-escaped '\"'.An escaped quote is one that is preceded by a '\\'.  Any time a backslash isfound, within a string, the next character is escaped, and the two of themtogether make one character.  For example, in java, c++, and c# \"\\n\" representsa new line, \"\\\"\" represents a quote, and \"\\\\\" represents a single '\\'(not two, because the first one escapes the second, and together they make one'\\').Your method must take all of this into consideration when removing comments.It must remove the rest of the line, when a \"//\" comment is found, and removecharacters starting with \"/*\" up to \"*/\" whenever a \"/*\" comment is found.  \n",
      "Inaddition, it must take into account that characters which are part of a String,cannot begin a comment (though they may end a comment which was previouslybegun by \"/*\").  You will be given an input String[], code, where each elementrepresents a line of code.  Your method should remove all of the commentedparts of the code, and return the result.  If, after removing commented text,any of the lines have been entirely removed, your return should not containelements for those lines.\n",
      "To summarize:\n",
      "Upon finding \"//\" (not in a String) - remove the entire rest of the line.\n",
      "Upon finding \"/*\" (not in a String) - remove all character until \"*/\"\n",
      "Upon finding '\"' (not in a comment) - all characters until the next unescapedquote are part of a String, and can not start a comment.\n",
      "Upon finding '\\' (in a String) - the next character is escaped, and can notclose the String.\n",
